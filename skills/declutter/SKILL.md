name: declutter
description: >-
  Find and delete unnecessary apps on macOS - unused GUI apps, brew formulae
  and casks, leftover Library dirs from uninstalled apps. Builds a dark,
  self-contained HTML report; the user picks what goes via checkboxes
  (exports declutter-selection.json); the skill deletes safely:
  brew uninstall for brew items, everything else moved to ~/.Trash, never rm.
  Use when the user asks to clean up their Mac, delete unused apps,
  free disk space, declutter, or find apps they do not use.

# declutter

Scan, report, user decides, delete safely. The skill judges nothing on its own:
badges are suggestions, checkboxes are the user's decision, Trash is the undo.

## Run

1. Scan + build report (read-only):

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/tmp/declutter
   python3 scripts/scan.py > ~/tmp/declutter/scan.json
   python3 scripts/report.py ~/tmp/declutter/scan.json -o ~/tmp/declutter/report.html
   open ~/tmp/declutter/report.html
   ```

   Requirements: macOS, python3 3.9+, Homebrew (optional - report works without).
   Scan needs Spotlight (`mdls`) for last-used dates; missing dates show as "unknown".

2. Tell the user: review the report, tick rows, press **Export selection**
   (lands in `~/Downloads/declutter-selection.json`). They may instead just
   tell you which rows to drop.

   Rows can also be marked **ignore** (link in the name column) - ignored rows
   stop appearing in future scans. If the export has an ignore list, apply it
   before anything else:

   ```sh
   python3 scripts/delete.py ~/Downloads/declutter-selection.json --save-ignore
   python3 scripts/scan.py > ~/tmp/declutter/scan.json   # re-scan, ignores now hidden
   python3 scripts/report.py ~/tmp/declutter/scan.json -o ~/tmp/declutter/report.html
   ```

3. Dry run (always first, never skip):

   ```sh
   python3 scripts/delete.py ~/Downloads/declutter-selection.json
   ```

4. Show the dry-run output, ask for explicit confirmation.

5. Only after a clear "yes, delete": `python3 scripts/delete.py ... --execute`.
   Then remind them to empty the Trash once happy.

## What the report shows

- Headline cards: items scanned, JUNK count, reclaimable bytes.
- Top-10 size bars.
- Sortable, filterable table: badge (KEEP/MAYBE/JUNK), name, size, last used,
  kind (app / formula / leftover). Locked rows: running apps, brew formulae
  other formulae need. Duplicate installs flagged.
- Badge rules: JUNK = unused 90+ days or never opened, MAYBE = 31-90 days,
  KEEP = used in the last 30 days.

## Safety rules

- Never run `--execute` without showing dry-run output and getting explicit
  user confirmation of that output.
- Deletion routes: brew cask -> `brew uninstall --cask`, brew formula ->
  `brew uninstall` (refused if any installed formula depends on it), manual
  apps and leftovers -> moved to `~/.Trash` (recoverable, never `rm`).
- `delete.py` refuses paths outside `/Applications`, `~`, Caskroom, Cellar.
- Leftover rows are heuristic (substring match) - tell the user to eyeball
  them before selecting.

## Phase 2 - files (built)

`scan.py` also scans regenerable file junk, same report and flow:
Xcode DerivedData (per project), CoreSimulator caches, brew/pip/yarn
caches, `~/Library/Logs`, and `node_modules` dirs (home-wide find,
depth 5). Sub-1MB crumbs are skipped. Age = directory mtime, so a
cache used today shows KEEP. All file rows go to Trash, things rebuild
on next use.
